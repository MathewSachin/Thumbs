View Thumbnails of Windows as they are generated in Desktop Windows Manager

Desktop Window Manager (DWM) enables the display of thumbnail representations of application windows.  
These are not static snapshots of a window, but are instead dynamic, constant connections between a thumbnail source window and a location on a destination window that receives the live thumbnail rendering.  
This allows a quick view of running applications by hovering over the application on the taskbar or using the ALT-TAB key gesture to see and quickly switch to an application.
